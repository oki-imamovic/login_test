Negative Scenario on UI Side would look something like this:

GIVEN I navigate to log in page
AND I click on Log in
THEN I am logged in into the app without creds

GIVEN I navigate to log in page
AND I click on Log in after I input only email
THEN I am logged in into the app without creds

GIVEN I navigate to log in page
AND I click on Log in after I input only password
THEN I am logged in into the app without creds

Same things stand for API testing, we have to make sure that the app is answering both questions who are you? and what are you allowed to do? (Authentication & Authorization)
