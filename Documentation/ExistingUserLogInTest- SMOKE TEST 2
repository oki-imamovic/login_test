TITLE: As existing user ISBAT log in into the app and validate my existing data

Description:
As existing user I should be able to log in into User contacts list app and validate that my existing contacts are present in the table
Test Steps:
GIVEN I navigate to page "https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/"
THEN I see the log in page
AND I input my existing user email
AND I input my existing user password
AND I click on log in button
THEN I validate that one of my contacts created is still present in the table (first name, last name, phone number, email, DOB, address, city and country)
AND I log out
THEN I validate that I am back on log in page


My Comment:
Reason why this is a smoke test:
We are just validating the core functionality that the existing user can log in and validate his expected results on the table
