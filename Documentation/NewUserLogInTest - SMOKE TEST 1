TITLE: As New user ISBAT log in into the app and validate that I do not have any data in the table

Description:
As a new user I want to log in for the first time into the app and validate that I have an empty table of Contacts
NOTE: use endpoint https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/users to create new user

Test Steps:
GIVEN I navigate to page "https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/"
THEN I see the log in page
AND I input my new user email
AND I input my new user password
AND I click on log in button
THEN I see that the app has opened and I validate that table has no records


My Comment:
Reason why this is a smoke test:
We are just validating the core functionality that the log in works and that the table is empty for a new user
